## intro

WOO! Get excited! We are in the information age, where an insane amount of information is at your fingertips. This is awesome if you're looking to learn, absorb, and grow.

This is a list I put together for a Women Who Code event in Chicago IL, December 10th 2015, so it is a little specific and not at all exhaustive. It's a quick list of resources I at least have a little experience or understanding of. It is only a snippet of what the wonderfully broad world wide web can offer!

Check out [my inspiration for this list](https://github.com/Michael0x2a/curated-programming-resources) for a way more extensive, curated list of tons of different languages and a little more in depth look at learning to program with these resources.

## resources

### LOCAL GROUPS/EVENTS
  A great way to learn if you think you learn better in person, by example, with interaction, and asking questions. Finding a community of people with your same goals is also a great self-esteem booster, motivator, resource tool, and networking builder!
  
#### [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/)
  
  Hopefully you know what this is since that's probably how you got here!

#### [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/)

  Similar to Women Who Code - lots of learning events
  
#### [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)

  Also similar - lots of hackathons and events

#### [Coder Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/)

  Aimed at children - physical location with classes
  
### LOCAL LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS
  If you prefer a more traditional setting to learn, this might be a great option. Libraries often have computer labs - check your local library's event schedule to see if they host any technology learning events. Technical colleges will obviously cost money but might be more affordable and accessible than a university degree or coding bootcamp.
  
### REFERENCE SITES
  These are sites that are a great place to bookmark as you learn and beyond! Even the most learned programmers visit these sites daily to look up things they can't remember or need help figuring out.
  
  In addition to these, languages often have their own docs and forums which will be vital! Look these up for sure.
  
#### [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

  Much like yahoo answers, this is a user-based question and answer site where anyone can ask a question and anyone can answer a question. The questions and anwswers are voted upon by other users for relevance, interest, clarity, and the like.
  
#### [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

  Docs, dev tools, and more!
  
### RESOURCE SITES

#### [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/)

  A huge list of media by type and topic.

#### [aGupieWare list](http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/05/online-learning-bachelors-level.html)

  A curated list of free online courses presented in a curriculum format.

#### [learn programming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming)

  A large, basically unmoderated forum of people learning to program. Check out the wiki (button located at the top) for an intro.
  
### FREE EDUCATION SITES

#### [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)

  A cool learning platform with a simple guided course where you can learn while helping nonprofits!
  
#### [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

  Very popular beginner's tutorials on many languages

#### [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

  Awesome free lessons on programming and lots more basic subjects.

#### [edX](https://www.edx.org/)

  Very cool platform for taking courses online from universities like Harvard, MIT, and more. Most are free with an option to pay for a certificate for completeing the course. I highly recommend CS50 offered through Harvard!

#### [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/)

  Published books about learning a few different languages made available for free in HTML format. A great way to actual dig in an learn a programming language by completeing exercises. (These are for beginners - don't let the name scare you away.)

#### [MIT OpenCourseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)

  MIT published courses on a variety of subjects! Find programming ones by Topic > Engineering > Computer Science > your sub topic!

#### [Code Avengers](https://www.codeavengers.com/)

  Project-based tutorials similar to Codecademy

#### [iTunes U](https://appsto.re/us/LgcoD.i)

  An app that I believe comes already installed on a iPhone or iPad. It looks a lot like the App Store only you can search through different organizations and universities to see what courses they offer.

### EDUCATION SITES WITH FREE OPTIONS

#### [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

  Offers paid and free courses - check each one to find the free ones. Their paid ones are more heavily promoted/seen so I would search by the topic you're interested in under Catalog. The ones starting with Intro are usually free. Their Nanodegrees are not, but might be an option for you! They are set up so you pay I believe $200/month with a partial refund if you complete a course within a timeframe.

#### [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

  Similar to Udacity but you pay per course rather than a monthly fee. For free courses, I would search by topic rather than course (by going [here](https://www.udemy.com/topics/)). After choosing your topic, the left menu shows a Free option to click and only list free courses.

### NOT FREE EDUCATION SITES

#### [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)

  Offers a free trial - offers 'Tracks' to take a series of courses to learn something broad like Front End Development, or their 'Library', which is all the info they have to offer. Monthly payment plan.

#### [Plural Sight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

  Offers a free trial per course. These courses are user uploaded (not created by the platform itself), but you can view by popularity. Also a monthly payment plan almost the exact same as Team Treehouse.

#### [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)

  A coding bootcamp offering full time and part time tracts. More relevantly, offers online courses and tutorials for a fee (per course).

### SPECIFIC TUTORIAL SITES

#### [Learn ___ .org](http://learn-c.org/about)

  Tutorials on specific languages

#### [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/)

  Ruby tutorials

#### [Open Vim](http://www.openvim.com/)

  Vim tutorial - vim is an editor many programmers use since you can use it only using your keyboard (no clicks). This is preferred for many "advanced" programmers whose activity is mostly typing, meaning they don't have to break up their seasoned, quick typing with mosue clicks.

#### [try git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

  Git is a version control system. A version control system alows you to work on code projects with other developers simultanesouly without overriding each other's code, maintaining records of changes, and lots of interesting, sometimes complicated, but super useful stuff.

#### [gitHub Wheelhouse]()
